# Notes
- The full adder design was copied from an IEEE article
    - I tried looking for the publication in order to cite it. It has alluded my grasp for 10 minutes, so alas...thou shall not pass :)

# Design
- The standard cell library was redesigned from `MP1` to `MP2`
    - The reason for this was to shorten the standard cell height
    - The cell library for MP2 was divided into two parts
        - `bitslice_rv32Lib.tar` : the bitsliced standard cell library
            - contains the bitslice schematic layout and design
        - `stdcell_rv32Lib.tar` : the basic standard cell library
            - contains new standard cell designs
